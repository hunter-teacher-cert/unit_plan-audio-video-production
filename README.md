# Using Coding in Video and Audio Production
by Ben Eckley

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
This is a unit for a brand new class I'm designing that will be using audio and video production as its main course of study. I would like to incorprate some kind of code based unit using (and I just learned about these) Processing and Sonic Pi

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

I was told by my admin they wanted me to create a video production class but plans are changing based on too many students in the class. I am motivated by the huge hole in this area of our MS/HS curriculum.

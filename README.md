# Using Coding in Video and Audio Production
by Ben Eckley

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
This is a unit for a brand new class I'm designing that will be using audio and video production as its main course of study. I would like to incorprate some kind of code based unit using (and I just learned about these) Processing and Sonic Pi

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

I was told by my admin they wanted me to create a video production class but plans are changing based on too many students in the class. I am motivated by the huge hole in this area of our MS/HS curriculum.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

---

### Tools Used
- Audio mixing board
- Soundtrap.com (or any DAW that we have available)
- Condenser Mics and boom stands
- Google Sites
- Scratch

---

### Resources
(include any links/books/readings to be used during this unit)

- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
- [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/)

### Lessons
Total lenght: 3 Weeks

(list each lesson with main topic(s))
1. Setting up equipment
2. Using mixing board with DAW
3. Learning the FX modules on mixing board and DAW
4. Recording with correct settings
5. Mixing
6. Mastering

---

### Assesments
(list summative and/or formative assessments used)
1. Students demonstrate knowledge of microphone placement and gain/volume/pattern useage
2. Students demonstrate ability to send audio signal from mixing board to computer creating a looped file in Soundtrap.
3. Students take recording from previous lesson and apply effects to it while annotating effects used and what they notice in the changes of their recordings.
4. Students record a full podcast in a small group of 3 to 4 students including music intro/outro, host introductions, main content, and sponsors.
5. Students will mixdown a rough draft of their podcasts for grading and assessment.
6. Students will cerate a final mastered version to publish to class website.
